    question: "Is Tally really free?",
    answer: "Yes! 99% of Tally's features are available for free. We make money through Tally Pro, a subscription for power users who need advanced features like team collaboration, custom domains, and removal of Tally branding."
  },

    question: "Are Tally forms secure?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We take security seriously. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We are GDPR compliant and host our data on secure servers in Europe."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Tally compare to other form builders?",
    answer: "Tally is the simplest form builder on the market. It works like a doc—just type your questions. No complex drag-and-drop builders. It's designed to be fast, beautiful, and completely free for most use cases."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I get started?",
    answer: "No signup is required to try it out! Just click the 'Create a free form' button at the top of this page. You can create an account later to save and publish your forms."
